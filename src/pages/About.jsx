        <h1>Rooted in Ocean Beach, crafting ethical connections everywhere</h1>
        <p>
          Variable Objects started as a collective of artists, technologists, and neighborhood advocates designing installations
          for the Ocean Beach Pier. We believe connection is more than bandwidthâ€”it&apos;s the trust between people, devices, and the
          communities they serve.
