# Variable Objects Web Experience

A lightweight React (ES module) experience for Variable Objects, an Ocean Beach, CA based IoT design studio. The site features an animated landing page, services overview, case studies, accessibility controls, and a contact form CTA that drafts an email to `awesome3dpf@proton.me`.

## Getting started

Because this project uses native ES modules and CDN-hosted React, no build step is required.

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Interact with the landing page, navigate between sections, and submit the contact form to launch your email client.

For local development with live reload, serve the folder using any static file server, such as:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then visit [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173).

## Features

- Animated hero with metrics grounded in published IoT research.
- Theme toggle (dark default) plus accessibility options for large text, high contrast, and reduced motion.
- Services, case studies, and about pages that highlight Variable Objects' art-meets-tech philosophy.
- Contact form CTA that opens an email to the studio and displays confirmation copy.
- Responsive design with subtle hover animations optimized for desktop and mobile.
